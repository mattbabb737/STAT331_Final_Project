## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

child_mortality_data <- read.csv(here::here("child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born.csv"))

CO2_emissions_data <- read.csv(here::here("co2_pcap_cons.csv"))


```

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
